# Unit 5 - User Interface (Junior Programmer: Create with Code 2 - learn.unity.com)

In the idle screen you can adjust the sound and choose the difficulty for the game. You need to left-click and drag to slash the thrown objects except the bomb (doing the same bomb will deduct points). If you miss 3 targets, you lose - but you can select the "restart" button to play the game again.
