# Unit 5 - User Interface (Junior Programmer: Create with Code 2 - learn.unity.com)

In the standby screen you can adjust the sound and choose the difficulty for the game. You need to drag the mouse to slash the items thrown up except for the bomb (by slashing the same bomb you will lose points). If you miss 3 items by slashing, you lose - but you can select the "restart" button to play the game again.
